### Q: How will the new-style Volume Control function now that the dial has been taken out?
A: The volume control is handled by the ATMEGA, so it means at ANY POINT that the ATMEGA is running can you do the combo and it will action it. There isn't a point where it won't happen so even during boot or even with the compute module removed you can adjust the volume! There is actually a digital potentiometer on the board that allows this to happen

### Q: Can I use a USB a to c cable to transfer data from my pc to the gameboy? Can any data transfer over that port.
A: You would use WIFI to transfer things over, the USB allows for uploading code to arduino, or for flashing the SD card (but you could just take the SD card out and do it like that). It's the same as the Pi Zero where plugging in the USB doesn't allow data transfer but you use wifi instead

### Q: Can i use HoolyHoo's screen brackets with the 640x480 screen ? (sold as an option)
A: Hoolyhoo’s bracket won’t work for the 640x480 screen. You will have no room left and right to lower the bracket and make it sit.
But after cutting the sides of the bracket, you can just put it on top of the screen and stick it and that way, you will have the screw posts still available for closing the case. Of course, this presumes you stick down the screen also
