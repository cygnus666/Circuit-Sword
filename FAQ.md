# Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What is the Circuit Sword?
A: The Circuit Sword is a single circuit board that contains all the required power/logic/io/peripherals to run a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3. This makes the Circuit Sword a single board computer capable of running any software designed for the Raspberry Pi. It includes special components designed for portability and ease of use, and so features battery charging and power/shutdown management as well as button input, LCD and audio output. The Circuit Sword is a perfect fit for retro handheld console form factors and they can provide a safe and secure enclosure for the board.

### Q: How much will it cost?
A: When the pre-order is opened, the individual item cost will be shown

***
### Q: How does the pre-order work? Is it here yet?
A: At an announced date/time a forum post will be created that contains all the information about the order including links to purchase. This purchase window will be open for 2 weeks. Once closed, all orders are counted and verified and then manufacture of the products starts. It takes around 2-3 months for the products to be fully made. When they arrive to me, I test and package each order and ship out within 1 week. The total time from order placement to product arrival is around 3-4 months.

### Q: What about other products that you have shown work in progress pictures of?
A: When those products have been fully completed and are ready for manufacture, and [email/post](https://github.com/kiteretro/Circuit-Sword/wiki/FAQ#q-when-will-the-next-pre-order-open) will go up about them.

### Q: Where do you ship to? How are your items shipped?
A: I ship to the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan (orders from countries outside of this list will not be processed). All items are shipped with tracking information via Royal Mail and will require a signature. Due to PayPal limitations all orders will be charged the international rate for postage (sorry UK customers). If you have any special postage requirements please include them in the notes section of your order.

### Q: How does ordering work? I've changed my mind!
A: Payment is by PayPal, I have used the 'add to cart' functionality and when you click the buttons above it will take you to a PayPal cart (you can keep adding things to the cart if you come back to this page, I suggest 'right click -> open in a new tab/window'). PayPal offers full buyer protection, any issues please get in contact with me first!

PLEASE SET YOUR ADDRESS CORRECTLY! You will be charged if re-shipment is required due to incorrect address, so get it right :) If you change your address please email me but please try to plan ahead where possible! It is very time consuming having to change individual order addresses.. If you request an address change after the order has been packed, you will need to re-pay for postage. If the order has already been sent out, it is your responsibility to track and collect the items. If the parcel is returned to me you will need to re-pay for postage. If it does not return it is your responsibility to follow up with the mail carrier.

Full refunds on all pre-orders cancelled before pre-orders close. cancellations made after pre-orders close will not be processed.

All items are tested to ensure that they are in good working condition before they are shipped, but should your item arrive damaged or faulty please contact (email) within 30 days to request a replacement/repair.
