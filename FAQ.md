### Q: How will the new-style Volume Control function now that the dial has been taken out?
A: The volume control is handled by the ATMEGA, so it means at ANY POINT that the ATMEGA is running can you do the combo and it will action it. There isn't a point where it won't happen so even during boot or even with the compute module removed you can adjust the volume! There is actually a digital potentiometer on the board that allows this to happen
