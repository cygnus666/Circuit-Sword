### Q: How do I pre-order?
A: Links to pre-orders will be provided via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kiteretro/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kiteretro) and [email](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfldWlIw2rxYdskP0xUDHvfQ84TIoc2HVhtLfzHKCbf89E-6Q/viewform) when they go live. Follow the link to the pre-order you're interested in and it will take you to a listing on [sudomod](https://www.sudomod.com/) that will provide you with all of the information you need to pre-order the items you want. Pre-orders always open for 2 weeks. Pre-orders are processed via PayPal. For combined shipping, I recommend opening a new tab for each item you want to pre-order so that you can add multiple items to your cart before proceeding to checkout. If you experience any problems, please feel free to contact me: kite@kitesitemshop.com.

### Q: How long until I receive my items?
A: From pre-order to postage = approximately 3 months. The Circuit Sword is a high-quality item so the manufacturing process takes time, but rest assured that as soon as they are ready they will be tested, packaged and shipped immediately with the utmost care! Thank you for your patience.

### Q: Where do you ship to? How are your items shipped?
A: I ship to the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan (orders from countries outside of this list will not be processed). All items are shipped with tracking information via Royal Mail and will require a signature. Due to PayPal limitations all orders will be charged the international rate for postage (sorry UK customers). If you have any special postage requirements please include them in the notes section of your order. International customers, please note that your country's import fees are out of my control.

### Q: What if I put in the wrong delivery address? What if I need to change my delivery address?
A: PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR DELIVERY ADDRESS IS UP TO DATE! If your delivery address needs to be updated email me asap: kite@kitesitemshop.com. You will be charged again for postage if:
1. Your items have already been packaged and given a tracking number when you email to update your delivery address.
2. Your items have already been shipped when you email to update your delivery address.
3. Your items are returned to me and need to be shipped again.

Should your items not be returned to me successfully, it is your responsibility to follow up with the mail carrier.

***
### Q: What if I change my mind? What is your returns policy?
A: I issue full refunds on all pre-orders cancelled before pre-orders close. Cancellations made after pre-orders close will not be processed. All items are tested to ensure that they are in good working condition before they are shipped, but should your item arrive damaged or faulty please contact me within 30 days to request a replacement/repair: kite@kitesitemshop.com.

Note that this is a PRE-ORDER. The money you pay to me is then paid directly to a circuit board manufacturer and four independent accessories suppliers. While I do everything in my power to reduce any risks and have been working with the same manufacturer and suppliers for 2+ years, this means that in the unlikely event I don't receive all of the items promised you will not receive a full refund. You will only receive a partial refund (naturally, postage will be refunded in full).

### Q: Do you test your items before you ship them?
A: Yes! I test and package all of my items by hand before shipping them.
