# Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What is the Circuit Sword? How much will it cost? What accessories are included?
A: The Circuit Sword is a single circuit board that contains all the required power/logic/io/peripherals to run a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3. This makes the Circuit Sword a single board computer capable of running any software designed for the Raspberry Pi. It includes special components designed for portability and ease of use, and so features battery charging and power/shutdown management as well as button input, LCD and audio output. The Circuit Sword is a perfect fit for retro handheld console form factors and they can provide a safe and secure enclosure for the board. When the pre-order opens the cost of all items will be shown.

### Q: How does the pre-order work? Is it here yet?
A: At an announced date/time a forum post will be created that contains all the information about the order including links to purchase. This purchase window will be open for 2 weeks. Once closed, all orders are counted and verified and then manufacture of the products starts. It takes around 2-3 months for the products to be fully made. When they arrive to me, I test and package each order and ship out within 1 week. The total time from order placement to product arrival is around 3-4 months.

### Q: How do I pre-order?
A: Payment is by PayPal, I have used the 'add to cart' functionality and when you click the buttons above it will take you to a PayPal cart (you can keep adding things to the cart if you come back to this page, I suggest 'right click -> open in a new tab/window'). PayPal offers full buyer protection, any issues please get in contact with me first!

### Q: Where do you ship to? How are your items shipped?
A: I ship to the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan (orders from countries outside of this list will not be processed). All items are shipped with tracking information via Royal Mail and will require a signature. Due to PayPal limitations all orders will be charged the international rate for postage (sorry UK customers). If you have any special postage requirements please include them in the notes section of your order. International customers, please note that your country's import fees are out of my control.

### Q: What if I put in the wrong delivery address? What if I need to change my delivery address?
A: PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR DELIVERY ADDRESS IS UP TO DATE! If your delivery address needs to be updated email me asap: kite@kitesitemshop.com. You will be charged again for postage if:
1. Your items have already been packaged and given a tracking number when you email to update your delivery address.
2. Your items have already been shipped when you email to update your delivery address.
3. Your items are returned to me and need to be shipped again.
Should your items not return to me successfully, it is your responsibility to follow up with the mail carrier.

### Q: What if I change my mind? What is your returns policy?
A: I issue full refunds on all pre-orders cancelled before pre-orders close. Cancellations made after pre-orders close will not be processed. All items are tested to ensure that they are in good working condition before they are shipped, but should your item arrive damaged or faulty please contact me within 30 days to request a replacement/repair: kite@kitesitemshop.com.

Note that this is a PRE-ORDER. The money you pay to me is then paid directly to a circuit board manufacturer and four independent accessories suppliers. While I do everything in my power to reduce any risks and have been working with the same manufacturer and suppliers for nearly 2 years, this means that in the unlikely event I don't receive all of the items promised you will not receive a full refund. You will only receive a partial refund (naturally, postage will be refunded in full).
