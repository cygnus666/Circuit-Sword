# GBO Case Modifications
This page walks through the physical modifications needed to a stock Game Boy case in order to fit (once all the original Game Boy motherboard and parts have been removed).

Not all steps are required, this is just a guide of what you **COULD** do. You do not have to follow it. Please read and determine for yourself if you want to do it for your build.

## General Overview
Generally speaking, you need to:
* [Make the display hole bigger](https://github.com/kiteretro/Circuit-Sword/wiki/GB-Original-Case-Mod-Guide#make-the-display-hole-biggercutting-out-the-lcd-space)
* [Add extra buttons on front (X and Y)](https://github.com/kiteretro/Circuit-Sword/wiki/GB-Original-Case-Mod-Guide#add-x-and-y-buttons)
* Cut out USB C charging connector
* Glue in new LCD and mounting posts (3D printed or otherwise)
* Stick in new LCD glass
* Glue in speaker
* _(Optional)_ Make holes for the status LEDs to shine through
* Glue in the power switch and mode button
* Add some kind of back buttons
* Add the back board

## Make the display hole bigger/cutting out the LCD space
This section details the removal of the excess plastic for the LCD and screen protector to fit.

Place your screen protector in place and measure up and mark out how much you need to remove:

On the inside, remove all posts that are in the way. If you plan to use these later for the mounting posts then make sure to cut them so that they are as long as possible:

Ideally use a knife cut out the area, or use a rotary cutting tool. Don't try and get it perfect first try, cut it out roughly and then use a knife to neaten up afterwards:

Pop out the cut:

Using a knife, carve the edges. The plastic is soft and cuts really easily:

Cheak regularly for fit:

Finished cutout. NOTE don't stick the protector in yet, do this AFTER you have glued the LCD in, otherwise it will be hard to clean and get dust free:

## Add X and Y buttons
This page will guide you through installing the extra X and Y buttons.

Pick which drill holes to use, 'normal' is recommended. Using a 1.5mm drill bit, push through and scratch the drill hole points. NOTE that if you are using a 3D printed button bracket, use the BRACKET to align the holes and NOT that main board. It doesn't matter if the buttons don't line up with the main board but it DOES matter if they don't line up with the bracket!

Remove posts in the way. Using a knife is recommended:

A sharp angle will get a clean cut. Be careful and work it slowly.. the plastic is soft:

Prepare by drilling pilot holes (3mm):

Line up with board and check for good alignment:

Using a step drill, turn slowly by hand. Put it pliers to get better grip:

Proceed to the 11mm mark:

Using a countersink bit, carefully make a countersunk edge to the hole:

Test for fit:

Repeat on other hole:

Prepare button wells for glueing. Get your parts, and work out how you want to fit it. Begin by sanding down the areas to glue to allow better adhesion:

Prepare tubes of paper in a cone shape, this will make it easier to line up:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/2.jpg]]

Insert tube from the inside:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/3.jpg]]

Place both tubes and line up notches:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/4.jpg]]

Glue with the tubes still inserted, when cooled remove and inspect:

Test fit:

Test fit and trim membrane. You may find that the bottom pictured needs cutting off. This makes the buttons feel firmer:

Trim the glue down if necessary:
