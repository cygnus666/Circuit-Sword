# GBO Case Modifications
This page walks through the physical modifications needed to a stock Game Boy case in order to fit (once all the original Game Boy motherboard and parts have been removed).

Not all steps are required, this is just a guide of what you **COULD** do. You do not have to follow it. Please read and determine for yourself if you want to do it for your build.

## General Overview
Generally speaking, you need to:
* [Make the display hole bigger](https://github.com/kiteretro/Circuit-Sword/wiki/GB-Original-Case-Mod-Guide#make-the-display-hole-biggercutting-out-the-lcd-space)
* [Add extra buttons on front (X and Y)](https://github.com/kiteretro/Circuit-Sword/wiki/GB-Original-Case-Mod-Guide#add-x-and-y-buttons)
* [Cut out USB C charging connector](https://github.com/kiteretro/Circuit-Sword/wiki/GB-Original-Case-Mod-Guide#usb-c-cutout)
* Glue in new LCD and mounting posts ([3D printed](https://github.com/kiteretro/Circuit-Sword/wiki/GB-Original-Case-Mod-Guide#fit-lcd-hoolyhoo-bracket) or [otherwise](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/wiki/LCD-gluing-posts))
* [Stick in new LCD glass](https://github.com/kiteretro/Circuit-Sword/wiki/GB-Original-Case-Mod-Guide#attach-glass)

## Make the display hole bigger/cutting out the LCD space
This section details the removal of the excess plastic for the LCD and screen protector to fit.

Place your screen protector in place and measure up and mark out how much you need to remove:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_CUT/1.jpg]]

On the inside, remove all posts that are in the way. If you plan to use these later for the mounting posts then make sure to cut them so that they are as long as possible:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_CUT/2.jpg]]

Ideally use a knife cut out the area, or use a rotary cutting tool. Don't try and get it perfect first try, cut it out roughly and then use a knife to neaten up afterwards:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_CUT/3.jpg]]

Pop out the cut:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_CUT/4.jpg]]

Using a knife, carve the edges. The plastic is soft and cuts really easily:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_CUT/5.jpg]]

Cheak regularly for fit:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_CUT/6.jpg]]

Finished cutout. NOTE don't stick the protector in yet, do this AFTER you have glued the LCD in, otherwise it will be hard to clean and get dust free:

## Add X and Y buttons
This page will guide you through installing the extra X and Y buttons.

Pick which drill holes to use, 'normal' is recommended. Using a 1.5mm drill bit, push through and scratch the drill hole points. NOTE that if you are using a 3D printed button bracket, use the BRACKET to align the holes and NOT that main board. It doesn't matter if the buttons don't line up with the main board but it DOES matter if they don't line up with the bracket!

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/1.jpg]]

Remove posts in the way. Using a knife is recommended:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/2.jpg]]

A sharp angle will get a clean cut. Be careful and work it slowly.. the plastic is soft:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/3.jpg]]

Prepare by drilling pilot holes (3mm):

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/4.jpg]]

Line up with board and check for good alignment:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/5.jpg]]

Using a step drill, turn slowly by hand. Put it pliers to get better grip:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/6.jpg]]

Proceed to the 11mm mark:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/7.jpg]]

Using a countersink bit, carefully make a countersunk edge to the hole:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/8.jpg]]

Test for fit:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/9.jpg]]

Repeat on other hole:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS/10.jpg]]

Prepare button wells for glueing. Get your parts, and work out how you want to fit it. Begin by sanding down the areas to glue to allow better adhesion:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/1.jpg]]

Prepare tubes of paper in a cone shape, this will make it easier to line up:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/2.jpg]]

Insert tube from the inside:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/3.jpg]]

Place both tubes and line up notches:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/4.jpg]]

Glue with the tubes still inserted, when cooled remove and inspect:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/5.jpg]]

Test fit:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/6.jpg]]

Test fit and trim membrane. You may find that the bottom pictured needs cutting off. This makes the buttons feel firmer:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/7.jpg]]

Trim the glue down if necessary:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_BUTTON_WELLS_GLUE/8.jpg]]

## USB C cutout
This section will guide you through fitting the USB power input port. This is the USB port on the top right of the board, and is used for charging. NOTE that the images shown show a Micro USB port, but the same applies to the USB C port.

Fit the board and using a marker, make marks for where to make the cut:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_USB_POWER/1.jpg]]

Join the dots:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_USB_POWER/2.jpg]]

Using a rotary tool or a knife start making cuts. Always cut it smaller than you need because you can use a knife to neaten up afterwards:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_USB_POWER/3.jpg]]

Rough cut:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_USB_POWER/4.jpg]]

Using a knife, carefully trim square:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_USB_POWER/5.jpg]]

Test fit with board and shell:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_USB_POWER/6.jpg]]

Neaten up more if necessary:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_USB_POWER/7.jpg]]

Trim and final fit:

## Fit LCD (Hoolyhoo bracket)
This section details how to glue HoolyHoos LCD adapter bracket.

Prepare and see how the LCD fits:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_HOOLYHOO/1.jpg]]

Cut out the LCD area:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_HOOLYHOO/2.jpg]]

Prepare the 2mm holes and put black marker on the inside of the edge. Prepare double sided tape too if necessary. You should prepare everything so that when the LCD is placed the LCD cover can be placed straight on to avoid dust getting on the LCD:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_HOOLYHOO/3.jpg]]

If using big LEDs, trim the plastic slightly:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_HOOLYHOO/4.jpg]]

Place LCD as pictured and run a bead of glue around the edge in the highlighted areas. You MUST glue this in. It would be a LOT better to use a 2 part epoxy for holding the bracket in. Over time and heat, hotglue will pull away and your build may start coming apart. Where possible use epoxy:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_HOOLYHOO/6.jpg]]

## Attach glass
Fit the screen protector. Typically they come with tape already applied, if not use regular double sided tape:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LCD_HOOLYHOO/7.jpg]]

## Fit speaker
This VECO 28mm speaker is my favourite and sounds pretty good! It does interfere with the battery bay slightly so you will need to make a cutout. If using the included speaker you do not need to make the cutout.

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_SPEAKER_VECO/1.jpg]]

Trim battery bay ONLY if the speaker interferes with it. If using the included speaker you won't need to do this:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_SPEAKER_VECO/2.jpg]

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_SPEAKER_VECO/3.jpg]]

## (Optional) LED status holes
This step is to make some holes for the built in LEDs to shine through.

Place board and mark on inside where the first LED should go:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LEDS/1.jpg]]

Using something sharp, poke a small hole through the plastic. It is quite soft:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LEDS/3.jpg]]

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LEDS/4.jpg]]

Drill out the hole:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LEDS/5.jpg]]

Place the template and mark the remaining holes:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LEDS/6.jpg]]

Drill all the holes out (2 or 3mm)

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LEDS/7.jpg]]

Cover outside in Kapton tape:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LEDS/8.jpg]]

Using a hot glue gun, fill the holes with glue. While the glue is hot, use a needle to pop the air bubble that gets created. Stiring inside the hole will help, and if it start cooling put the glue gun back on. Use the tip of the glue gun to move any excess glue away and peel off:

[[images/CSO/BUILD/GBO_LEDS/9.jpg]]

The end result will let the LEDs shine through the opaque glue:
