# GBO Case Modifications
This page walks through the physical modifications needed to a stock Game Boy case in order to fit (once all the original Game Boy motherboard and parts have been removed).

Not all steps are required, this is just a guide of what you **COULD** do. You do not have to follow it. Please read and determine for yourself if you want to do it for your build.

## General Overview
Generally speaking, you need to:
* [Make the display hole bigger](https://github.com/geebles/Circuit-Sword/wiki/GB-Original-Case-Mod-Guide/_edit#make-the-display-hole-biggercutting-out-the-lcd-space)
* Add extra buttons on front (X and Y)
* Cut out USB C charging connector
* Glue in new LCD and mounting posts (3D printed or otherwise)
* Stick in new LCD glass
* Glue in speaker
* _(Optional)_ Make holes for the status LEDs to shine through
* Glue in the power switch and mode button
* Add some kind of back buttons
* Add the back board
* _(Optional)_ Add a blank cartridge
* _(Optional)_ Add a joystick

## Make the display hole bigger/cutting out the LCD space
This section details the removal of the excess plastic for the LCD and screen protector to fit.

Place your screen protector in place and measure up and mark out how much you need to remove:

On the inside, remove all posts that are in the way. If you plan to use these later for the mounting posts then make sure to cut them so that they are as long as possible:

Ideally use a knife cut out the area, or use a rotary cutting tool. Don't try and get it perfect first try, cut it out roughly and then use a knife to neaten up afterwards:

Pop out the cut:

Using a knife, carve the edges. The plastic is soft and cuts really easily:

Cheak regularly for fit:

Finished cutout. NOTE don't stick the protector in yet, do this AFTER you have glued the LCD in, otherwise it will be hard to clean and get dust free:
