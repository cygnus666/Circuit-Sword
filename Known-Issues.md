# Known Issues and Workarounds
This page will detail any known issues and potential ways to avoid or solve them.

## Issue 1 - The MODE button is very short and doesn't poke out much.
**Cause:** This happened due to mis-communication when product was manufactured

**Solution 2:** Make some kind of extension (3D print a hat for it?)

## Issue 2 - The volume with button combo is very slow to update
**Cause:** The very first software image had a second delay between each check (at best case!)
