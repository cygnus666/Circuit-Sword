Welcome to the Circuit-Sword wiki! This wiki provides all documentation for the Circuit Sword projects. If you have a product named something else (e.g. Super AIO, SAIO, Super All in One, etc) then this isn't the wiki for you. If you have a Circuit Sword then keep reading!

# What is the Circuit Sword?
The Circuit Sword is a single circuit board that contains all the required power/logic/io/peripherals to run a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3. This makes the Circuit Sword a single board computer capable of running any software designed for the Raspberry Pi. It includes special components designed for portability and ease of use, and so features battery charging and power/shutdown management as well as button input, LCD and audio output. The Circuit Sword is a perfect fit for retro handheld console form factors and they can provide a safe and secure enclosure for the board.

* Mini HDMI out with display cloning
* Audio adjustable with MODE + UP/DOWN button combo
* Built in Wifi (BT 4.0 included on board but not tested)
* Single FPC between front and back halves of case (much easier to close/assemble/test)
* USB C connector (easier to cut hole for, higher charge rates)
* Battery connector accessible in battery bay
* 1.5A Charger with better thermal relief
* More powerful 'load balancing' when switching between USB and Battery power
* ALL components moved to the back side
* USB HUB, Arduino ATMEGA32u4 for input, external USB port
* Many more subtle improvements

# What can it do?
The Circuit Sword is a miniature single board computer and various software packages can be loaded and run on it. For example raspbian or retropie distributions are good use cases.

# Where do I get one?
