# What do the configuration switches do?
Accessible from the battery bay are 4x micro switches that change the behavior of the USB C port at the side of the Circuit Sword.

* PI-PASSTHRU = Connect the USB C port to the Compute Module USB (directly)
* HUB-PASSTHRU = Connect the USB C port to the USB HUB INPUT
* PROG-EN = Put the Compute Module into USB mount mode ([rpi-boot](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/computemodule/cm-emmc-flashing.md))
* USB-SD-EN = Not used, connected to the solder point "G-SW" for misc use
